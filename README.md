# Music Wearable MQP 2017
This app is designed to select music based on fitness data collected on an Android Wear device. This implementation primarily serves as a proof-of-concept, and performs as such.

## Notes/Helpful Info:
 - This App was written for Android Wear  1.5 (1.5.0.3336103 if you really care) on Android 6.0.1. NO idea what will/will not work on the recently released Wear 2.0.
 - Unpairing an Android Wear device from a phone causes the Wear device to factory reset. AKA you can't just share the device between phones.
 - You will need to enable developer mode on both your phone and watch. This is generally accomplished by rapidly tapping "Build Number" in "About Phone/Device/Etc" within device settings, but YMMV.
 - Make sure to authorize both the phone and watch for ADB

 ### Using Android Studio and Wear with no Main Activity:

To fix the error in Android Studio that doesn't allow directly launching the Wear component ("Main Activity Not Found"), do the following ([via StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/40113469)):
Run -> Edit Configurations -> Android App -> wear -> General -> Launch Options -> **Launch: Nothing**

Alternatively, you can build the apks (Build -> Build APK from within Android Studio) and then install it manually via ADB (see below for how to connect to wear device over Bluetooth).

### Debugging Over Bluetooth:
After configuring and enabling ADB (see Source: [Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/bt-debugging.html "Debugging over Bluetooth | Android Developers") and ADB help files), run the following to link the debugger to the watch: 

    adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub     //Any port you have full access to should work.
    adb connect 127.0.0.1:4444                          

You can then run any ADB command as follows:
`adb -s 127.0.0.1:4444 [some command]`
